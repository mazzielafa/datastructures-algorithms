/*

1. Stacks & Queues:
Stacks - stores items into last-in, first-out order
Queues - first-in, first-out order
    Push
    Pop
    Enqueue
    Dequeue

2. Linked List - organise items sequentially with each item storing a pointer to the next
    Head - Entry point, need to start here
    Singular linked list has one direction
    Value or next - point to its own value
    Tail - We don't know what's behind it unless we have a double linked list

    Linked list are a type of graph
    (e.g <64<72<95<29>) if we want to change the pointer, change the next property to point to the integer

    Hash tables often used linked list to handle collisions  

3. Hash Table - Organises data for quick look up on values for a given key
    Not orders
    Fast look ups
    Can be used to find the value of an interger - when implementing, need to define how much
    Once 50% full, need to double it

    Set - Doesn't save a value, saves a property name
    .has .get .set
    {}, Map, Set

4. Array - Organises items sequentially in memory
    Can be looked up by key, can insert something in the middle (shift & delete in the middle of an array)

    value with _(variableName) means it's private and we should not be accessing it outside of the class.
